<h2 class="chapter" id="Terminology-1">2 Terminology</h2>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">package</em> is a related collection of files and directories that
you wish to administer as a unit &mdash; e.g., Perl or Emacs &mdash; and that needs
to be installed in a particular directory structure &mdash; e.g., with
<samp class="file">bin</samp>, <samp class="file">lib</samp>, and <samp class="file">man</samp> subdirectories.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-target-directory"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">target directory</em> is the root of a tree in which one or more
packages wish to <em class="emph">appear</em> to be installed.  <samp class="file">/usr/local</samp> is a
common choice for this, but by no means the only such location.  Another
common choice is <samp class="file">~</samp> (i.e. the user&rsquo;s <code class="code">$HOME</code> directory) in
the case where Stow is being used to manage the user&rsquo;s configuration
(&ldquo;dotfiles&rdquo;) and other files in their <code class="code">$HOME</code>.  The examples in
this manual will use <samp class="file">/usr/local</samp> as the target directory.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-stow-directory"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">stow directory</em> is the root of a tree containing separate
packages in private subtrees.  When Stow runs, it uses the current
directory as the default stow directory.  The examples in this manual
will use <samp class="file">/usr/local/stow</samp> as the stow directory, so that
individual packages will be, for example, <samp class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl</samp>
and <samp class="file">/usr/local/stow/emacs</samp>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-installation-image"></a>
<p>An <em class="dfn">installation image</em> is the layout of files and directories
required by a package, relative to the target directory.  Thus, the
installation image for Perl includes: a <samp class="file">bin</samp> directory containing
<samp class="file">perl</samp> and <samp class="file">a2p</samp> (among others); an <samp class="file">info</samp> directory
containing Texinfo documentation; a <samp class="file">lib/perl</samp> directory containing
Perl libraries; and a <samp class="file">man/man1</samp> directory containing man pages.
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p><b class="b">Note:</b> This is a <em class="emph">pre-</em>installation image which exists even before Stow
has installed any symlinks into the target directory which point to it.
</p></blockquote>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package-directory"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package-name"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">package directory</em> is the root of a tree containing the
installation image for a particular package.  Each package directory
must reside in a stow directory &mdash; e.g., the package directory
<samp class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl</samp> must reside in the stow directory
<samp class="file">/usr/local/stow</samp>.  The <em class="dfn">name</em> of a package is the name of its
directory within the stow directory &mdash; e.g., <samp class="file">perl</samp>.
</p>
<p>Thus, the Perl executable might reside in
<samp class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl/bin/perl</samp>, where <samp class="file">/usr/local</samp> is the
target directory, <samp class="file">/usr/local/stow</samp> is the stow directory,
<samp class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl</samp> is the package directory, and
<samp class="file">bin/perl</samp> within is part of the installation image.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="symlink"></a><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-symlink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-symlink-source"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-symlink-destination"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-relative-symlink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-absolute-symlink"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">symlink</em> is a symbolic link, i.e. an entry on the filesystem
whose path is sometimes called the <em class="dfn">symlink source</em>, which points to
another location on the filesystem called the <em class="dfn">symlink destination</em>.
There is no guarantee that the destination actually exists.
</p>
<p>In general, symlinks can be <em class="dfn">relative</em> or <em class="dfn">absolute</em>.  A symlink
is absolute when the destination names a full path; that is, one
starting from <samp class="file">/</samp>.  A symlink is relative when the destination
names a relative path; that is, one not starting from <samp class="file">/</samp>.  The
destination of a relative symlink is computed starting from the
symlink&rsquo;s own directory, i.e. the directory containing the symlink
source.
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p><b class="b">Note:</b> Stow only creates symlinks within the target directory which point to
locations <em class="emph">outside</em> the target directory and inside the stow
directory.
</p>
<p>Consequently, we avoid referring to symlink destinations as symlink
<em class="emph">targets</em>, since this would result in the word &ldquo;target&rdquo; having
two different meanings:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> the target directory, i.e. the directory into which Stow targets
installation, where symlinks are managed by Stow, and

</li><li> the destinations of those symlinks.

</li></ol>

<p>If we did not avoid the second meaning of &ldquo;target&rdquo;, then it would lead
to confusing language, such as describing Stow as installing symlinks
into the target directory which point to targets <em class="emph">outside</em> the
target directory.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the word &ldquo;source&rdquo; can have two different meanings in this
context:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> the installation image, or some of its contents, and

</li><li> the location of symlinks (the &ldquo;source&rdquo; of the link, vs. its
destination).

</li></ol>

<p>Therefore it should also be avoided, or at least care taken to ensure
that the meaning is not ambiguous.
